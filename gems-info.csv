aasm,https://github.com/aasm/aasm,"AASM is a continuation of the acts-as-state-machine rails plugin, built for plain Ruby objects.","This package contains AASM, a library for adding finite state machines to Ruby classes. AASM started as the acts_as_state_machine plugin but has evolved into a more generic librarythat no longer targets only ActiveRecord models. It currently provides adapters for manyORMs but it can be used for any Ruby class, no matter what parent class it has (if any). Take a look at the README_FROM_VERSION_3_TO_4 for details how to switch from version 3.x to 4.0 of AASM. Adding a state machine is as simple as including the AASM module and start definingstates and events together with their transitions: This provides you with a couple of public methods for instances of the class Job:"

ancestry,https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry/," Ancestry allows the records of a ActiveRecord model to be organized in a tree  structure, using the materialized path pattern. It exposes the standard  relations (ancestors, parent, root, children, siblings, descendants)  and allows them to be fetched in a single query. Additional features include  named scopes, integrity checking, integrity restoration, arrangement  of (sub)tree into hashes and different strategies for dealing with orphaned  records.","Ancestry is a gem that allows the records of a Ruby on RailsActiveRecord model to be organised as a tree structure (or hierarchy). It employsthe materialised path pattern and exposes all the standard tree structurerelations (ancestors, parent, root, children, siblings, descendants), allowing allof them to be fetched in a single SQL query. Additional features include STIsupport, scopes, depth caching, depth constraints, easy migration from oldergems, integrity checking, integrity restoration, arrangement of(sub)trees into hashes, and various strategies for dealing with orphanedrecords. NOTE: Follow these simple steps to apply Ancestry to any ActiveRecord model: Depending upon your comfort with databases, you may want to create the columnwith C or POSIX encoding. This is a more primitive encoding and just comparesbytes. Since this column will just contains numbers and slashes, it works muchbetter. It also works better for the uuid case as well. Alternatively, if you create a text_pattern_ops index for your postgresql column, subtree selection will use an efficient index for you regardless of whether you created the column with POSIX encoding."

You start a form with one of bootstrap_form_with, bootstrap_form_for, or bootstrap_form_tag in a view file. You get a form builder that calls the bootstrap_form helpers instead of the standard Rails helpers. You use that form builder in the view file to render one or more form fields. bootstrap_form supports at a minimum the currently supported versions of Ruby and Rails: Install Bootstrap 5.

But be warned, less.rb relies on a JavaScript runtime gem too. Just like ExecJS, it will look for a gem that is appropriate to your system. Typically, this means you will need one of the following. This gem was made for other gems to properly hook into one place to provide paths to the Less::Parser. For example, the less-rails-bootstrap project at http://github.com/metaskills/less-rails-bootstrap and each project should do the path configuration for you. If you need to, you can configure less-rails with additional paths. These paths have higher priority than those from your applications assets load paths. If config.assets.compress is set to true, we will set the config.less.compress to true as well. Less has real basic compression and it is recommended that you set the rails config.assets.css_compressor to something more stronger like :yui in your config/environments/production.rb file. Note, this requires the yui-compressor gem but does an excellent job of compressing assets."

Puma processes requests using a C-optimized Ragel extension (inherited from Mongrel) that provides fast, accurate HTTP 1.1 protocol parsing in a portable way.

Originally designed as a server for Rubinius, Puma also works well with Ruby (MRI) and JRuby. On MRI, there is a Global VM Lock (GVL) that ensures only one thread can run Ruby code at a time. But if you're doing a lot of blocking IO (such as HTTP calls to external APIs like Twitter), Puma still improves MRI's throughput by allowing IO waiting to be done in parallel."

rails,https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v7.0.2.3,Ruby on Rails is a full-stack web framework optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It encourages beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration.,"Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides yourapplication into three layers: Model, View, and Controller, each with a specific responsibility. The Model layer represents the domain model (such as Account, Product,Person, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic specific toyour application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived fromActiveRecord::Base. Active Record allows you to present the data fromdatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logicmethods.Although most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinaryRuby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided bythe Active Model module. The View layer is composed of ""templates"" that are responsible for providingappropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates cancome in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embeddedRuby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller responseor to generate the body of an email. In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View. The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests andproviding a suitable response. Usually, this means returning HTML, but Rails controllerscan also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers load andmanipulate models, and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response.In Rails, incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller, andcontroller classes are derived from ActionController::Base. Action Dispatch and Action Controllerare bundled together in Action Pack. Active Record, Active Model, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently outside Rails.In addition to that, Rails also comes with Action Mailer, a libraryto generate and send emails; Action Mailbox, a library to receive emails within a Rails application;Active Job, a framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queuingbackends; Action Cable, a framework tointegrate WebSockets with a Rails application; Active Storage, a library to attach cloudand local files to Rails applications; Action Text, a library to handle rich text content;and Active Support, a collectionof utility classes and standard library extensions that are useful for Rails,and may also be used independently outside Rails."

In yourviews you can use the recaptcha_tags method to embed the needed javascript, and you can validatein your controllers with verify_recaptcha or verify_recaptcha!, which raises an error onfailure. Go to the reCAPTCHA admin console to obtain a reCAPTCHA API key. The reCAPTCHA type(s) that you choose for your key will determine which methods to use below. Note: You can only use methods that match your key's type. You cannot use v2 methods with a v3key or use recaptcha_tags with a v2 Invisible key, for example. Otherwise you will get anerror like ""Invalid key type"" or ""This site key is not enabled for the invisible captcha."""

This project does its best to follow semantic versioning practices. Check the CHANGELOG to see detailed versioning notes, and UPGRADING for notes about major changes or deprecations. BunnyMock can be injected into your RabbitMQ application in place of Bunny for testing. For example, if you have a helper module named AMQFactory, some code similar to the following placed in spec_helper or test_helper or what have you is all you need to start using BunnyMock to test your RabbitMQ application For an example, easy to mock setup, check out this helper Here are some examples showcasing what BunnyMock can do"
rails,https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v7.0.2.3,Ruby on Rails is a full-stack web framework optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It encourages beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration.,"Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides yourapplication into three layers: Model, View, and Controller, each with a specific responsibility. The Model layer represents the domain model (such as Account, Product,Person, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic specific toyour application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived fromActiveRecord::Base. Active Record allows you to present the data fromdatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logicmethods.Although most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinaryRuby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided bythe Active Model module. The View layer is composed of ""templates"" that are responsible for providingappropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates cancome in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embeddedRuby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller responseor to generate the body of an email. In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View. The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests andproviding a suitable response. Usually, this means returning HTML, but Rails controllerscan also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers load andmanipulate models, and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response.In Rails, incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller, andcontroller classes are derived from ActionController::Base. Action Dispatch and Action Controllerare bundled together in Action Pack. Active Record, Active Model, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently outside Rails.In addition to that, Rails also comes with Action Mailer, a libraryto generate and send emails; Action Mailbox, a library to receive emails within a Rails application;Active Job, a framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queuingbackends; Action Cable, a framework tointegrate WebSockets with a Rails application; Active Storage, a library to attach cloudand local files to Rails applications; Action Text, a library to handle rich text content;and Active Support, a collectionof utility classes and standard library extensions that are useful for Rails,and may also be used independently outside Rails."

sass-rails,https://github.com/rails/sass-rails,Sass adapter for the Rails asset pipeline.,"Since Rails 3.1, new Rails projects will be already configured to use Sass. If you are upgrading to Rails 3.1 you will need to add the following to your Gemfile: To configure Sass via Rails set use config.sass in yourapplication and/or environment files to set configurationproperties that will be passed to Sass. The list of supported Sass optionscan be found on the Sass Website with the following caveats: Sprockets provides some directives that are placed inside of comments called require, require_tree, andrequire_self. DO NOT USE THEM IN YOUR SASS/SCSS FILES. They are veryprimitive and do not work well with Sass files. Instead, use Sass's native @import directive whichsass-rails has customized to integrate with the conventions of your Rails projects. When in Rails, there is a special import syntax that allows you toglob imports relative to the folder of the stylesheet that is doing the importing."

It is not a reporting tool or a publishing toolchain,though it could be fairly easily used to build those things. One thing Prawn is not, and will never be, is an HTML to PDF generator. Forthose needs, consider looking into FlyingSaucer via JRuby, or one of the WebKitbased tools, like Wicked or PDFKit. We do have basic support for inline stylingbut it is limited to a very small subset of functionality and is not suitablefor rendering rich HTML documents. Because Prawn is pure Ruby and all of its runtime dependencies are maintained byus, it should work pretty much anywhere. We officially support all Ruby versionssuported by Ruby Core Team and JRuby versions of matching Ruby version. Howeverwe will accept patches to fix problems on other Ruby platforms if they aren'ttoo invasive. Prawn is distributed via RubyGems, and can be installed the usual way that youinstall gems: by simply typing gem install prawn on the command line."
